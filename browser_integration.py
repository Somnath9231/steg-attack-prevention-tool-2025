Browser Integration Stub for Steganography Attack Prevention Tool

This module is a placeholder for future development of browser extension or
OS-level hooks to monitor images loaded in browsers for steganography.

Planned features:
- Monitor images loaded in browser tabs.
- Scan images in real-time using detection algorithms.
- Alert users on suspicious content.
- Integrate with popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox) via extensions or native messaging.

Note: Full implementation requires browser extension development and is beyond
the scope of this initial tool version.
